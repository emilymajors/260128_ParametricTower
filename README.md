# 260128_ParametricTower

260128_ParametricTower is a browser-based parametric tower generator that stacks box-shaped floor slabs and lets you control twist, scale, height, bending, shape morphing, and color gradients in real time with UI sliders.

## Features
- Stacked slab tower with per-floor twist and scale gradients
- Independent twist gradients for X, Y, and Z axes
- Smooth curve options (linear, smoothstep, ease-in-out cubic)
- Bottom-to-top color gradient controls
- Macaroni-style bend controls with direction
- Shape gradient morphing (square, circle, triangle)
- Reset buttons per control group
- Orbit camera controls and realtime updates

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run the local server: `npm run dev`
3. Open `http://localhost:5173`

## Controls
- Floors, floor height, slab size, slab thickness
- Shape bottom/top and curve type
- Twist X/Y/Z min/max and curve type
- Scale min/max and curve type
- Bend angle, direction, and curve type
- Top and bottom colors
- Material roughness and metalness
- Reset per folder
